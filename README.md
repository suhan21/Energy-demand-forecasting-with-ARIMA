# Energy-demand-forecasting-with-ARIMA

Energy demand forecasting with ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular approach for time series analysis, where historical energy consumption data is used to predict future demand. 
1. Data Preparation

    Collect historical energy demand data, typically on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis.
    Check for seasonality, trends, and outliers in the data, as ARIMA models assume stationarity.
    If necessary, transform the data (e.g., log or differencing) to make it stationary, which stabilizes the mean and removes trends.

2. Stationarity Testing

    Use tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) or KPSS to assess if the data is stationary.
    If the data is non-stationary, apply differencing to make it stationary. For seasonal data, seasonal differencing may be needed.

3. Model Selection (ARIMA Hyperparameters)

    Identify the ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q):
        p: Order of the autoregressive (AR) part.
        d: Order of differencing needed to make the series stationary.
        q: Order of the moving average (MA) part.
    Use tools like autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots to help select p and q.

4. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) for Seasonal Demand Patterns

    If the data shows seasonal patterns, use SARIMA, which includes seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, m), where m is the season length (e.g., m = 12 for monthly seasonal data).
    This approach helps capture periodic patterns, such as seasonal energy demand.

5. Model Training

    Fit the ARIMA/SARIMA model on historical energy demand data.
    Use an iterative approach to optimize parameters (e.g., through grid search or AIC/BIC criteria).

6. Model Evaluation

    Use a portion of historical data as the test set to evaluate model performance.
    Common metrics for evaluation include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

7. Forecasting

    Once trained, use the ARIMA model to forecast future energy demand over desired periods (e.g., short-term hourly or long-term seasonal forecasts).
    Generate confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty of forecasts.

8. Updating the Model

    Energy demand patterns can change over time. Regularly update the model with new data to improve accuracy.
    Use rolling forecasts or re-train periodically to keep the model relevant.

9. Applications in Energy Management

    Use ARIMA forecasts for load balancing, grid management, and optimizing energy generation schedules.
    Accurate demand forecasting helps reduce costs by aligning supply with demand and preventing overproduction.
